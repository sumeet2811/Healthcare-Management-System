# Healthcare Appointment System - Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Form Binding Issue**: Updated the form in ShowAvailableDoctorsSchedulePage.html to properly bind to the Schedule object.
2. **Controller Initialization**: Fixed the PatientController to properly initialize the command2 object.
3. **Error Handling**: Added better error handling in the AppointmentServiceImpl.
4. **Stored Procedure**: Created an updated version of the book_appointment stored procedure.

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Update the Stored Procedure**:
   - Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench)
   - Connect to your database
   - Run the SQL script in `src/main/resources/update_procedure.sql`

2. **Rebuild the Application**:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Testing the Appointment Booking

1. Login as a patient
2. Go to "Request Appointment"
3. Select a date
4. From the list of available doctors, enter a doctor ID in the form
5. Click "Book Appointment"

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the database tables to ensure they match the entity classes:
   - appointments
   - procedureappointment
   - patient
   - doctor
   - regular_schedule

2. Verify that the stored procedure was created successfully:
   ```sql
   SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS WHERE Name = 'book_appointment';
   ```

3. Check the application logs for any errors.
